    <p>A Raspberry Pi has many ports and 40 pins. The ports depend on the model of Raspberry Pi you have.
        A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ will be used in this example.
    </p>
    <h3>Ports</h3>
    <p>On a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, there are 4 USB ports, an ethernet port, 
        a micro-USB port for power, an HDMI port, audio jack, camera module port,
        and microSD card slot.</p>

    <h3>Pinout</h3>
    <p>When it comes to the pinout, it will remain the same for every Raspberry Pi model. These pins allow
        users to combine digital logic with physical input and action.
